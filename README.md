# rofltemp_1-pcb

This is the circuit schematic and board layout project for the ROFLtemp-1 multi-purpose
RTD thermometer.
# WARNING! DO NOT BUILD WITH THESE DESIGN FILES! Several stupid errors are in this layout that will be corrected in the final version!

# Features:
 - High accuracy RTD (PT1000) 4-wire measurement
 - Filtering for measurement inputs for high immunity in noisy enviroments (I'm looking at you, induction stoves!)
 - USB connectivity for LiPo battery charging, firmware update and data-logging
 - High brightness 7-segment LED display for good readability even in daylight
 - 0.1° resolution on 3-digit display -> above 99.9 displayed resolution will drop to 1°
